# Overview

In this repository, I aim to learn new programming languages and frameworks, learn best practices for version control, and master debugging tools and techniques.

The classic Fijian Card Game is a digital version of a traditional Fijian card game, designed for players to enjoy with friends or against AI opponents. The game features a set of unique rules, card types, and strategies, bringing the cultural essence of the Fijian game to the digital world. Players can engage in a competitive and fun way while learning about the traditions behind the game.

The purpose of creating this software is to gain a foundation in game development. I've always wanted to create a game through code, and this project will help me build the  skills necessary for developing engaging and interactive gameplay experiences.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

The tools I will use to develop my software include VS Code as the code editor, GitHub for version control, and Trello for task organization.

The programming languages I used is Python.
